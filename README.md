# csvToolbox
Just a place to keep various csv manipulators.


Depending on the frequency of need, these can and likely will start as the basis of an interactive commandline csv toolbox.

Some ideas to include:  

* ability to find cells that are too large for the cell limit
* ability to find and fill cells based on relationships with other tables
* ability to provide column and document statistics:
    * ability count the number of unique values in a column
    * count the number of empty cells
    * attempt to find any large recurring things
* potential other uses:
    * ability to import a csv, and then add a column with the new contact's id

see if I could set shebang to run from the portable python, then launch from command line
