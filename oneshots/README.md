#Welcome to oneshots

This folder is for things that were written as a onetime solution for something.
The functions that they use may prove useful down the line, but they have not been
written in a way that would intentionally be easy to adapt to a different situation. 

If you find something that would be useful to a situation, please either 

* use it as a template for something that can be done repeatably 
    * and then do a pull request adding it to the appropriate folder 
* let me know that you want it made so you can use it
    * I may or may not be able to change it quickly, but I will let you know
* send me the changes that you made to suite your needs. With an idea of what
changed I will have an easier time figuring out what changes need to be made for
further ease of use.
