Hello and welcome to the documentation folder.  If this is your first time here, I suggest checking
out the file "[anIntroduction](./anIntroduction.md)". Other than that, please find documentation in 
this folder for each included file by name. There should also be a bestpractices folder with some
basic workflows in it. Note that these workflows should evolve as new issues and solutions are found,
improved, or simplified. **Please** help this process by contributing any workflows that you find to
be useful. 

[chars.txt](./chars.txt) is a file of ascii chars and their char() values. It can be handy
when determining what values are in the document

Until it can be parsed into an easier to reverence manner, you can use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters
as a good collection of unicode characters. 

[tables.py](./tables.py) is a dictionary of the different tables and their relevant 
columns.
