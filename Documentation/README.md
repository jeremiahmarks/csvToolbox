Hello and welcome to the documentation folder.  If this is your first time here, I suggest checking
out the file "[anIntroduction](./anIntroduction.md)". Other than that, please find documentation in 
this folder for each included file by name. There should also be a bestpractices folder with some
basic workflows in it. Note that these workflows should evolve as new issues and solutions are found,
improved, or simplified. **Please** help this process by contributing any workflows that you find to
be useful.
