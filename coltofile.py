# This file attempts to provide a way to visualize large 
# data sets three ways:
    # Converting the data in the csv file into a binary display of cells with/without information in
        # them. This could easily be included to exclude or include based on the needle.
    # Convert the data into space or character padded cells so that it is easy to distinguish where
        # each column is starting and ending.
